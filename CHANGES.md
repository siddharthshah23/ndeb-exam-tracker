# Recent Changes

## 🎯 Latest Update - Separated Revision and Overall Progress Gadgets (2025-10-03)

### Overview
Separated the progress tracking gadgets on the dashboard to clearly distinguish between:
1. **Overall Progress** - Based on pages completed + 3 revisions across all subjects
2. **Revision Progress** - Based on the 3-revision cycle system (0/3, 1/3, 2/3, 3/3)

### What Changed

#### 1. Updated Types (`lib/types.ts`)
Added new fields to `ProgressStats` interface:
- `revisionProgress: number` - Average revision cycle progress (0-3 scale)
- `chaptersAt0Revisions: number` - Chapters with 0 revisions
- `chaptersAt1Revision: number` - Chapters with 1 revision
- `chaptersAt2Revisions: number` - Chapters with 2 revisions
- `chaptersAt3Revisions: number` - Chapters with 3 revisions
- `totalChapters: number` - Total number of chapters

#### 2. Enhanced Progress Calculation (`lib/firestoreHelpers.ts`)
Updated `calculateProgress` function to:
- **Calculate overall progress based on BOTH pages AND revisions**
  - Total work required = Total pages × 4 (initial read + 3 revisions)
  - Work completed = Pages completed + (Pages × Revisions for completed chapters)
  - This means 100% = All pages read + All 3 revisions completed
- Track revision distribution across all chapters
- Calculate average revision progress (X.X/3.0)
- Count chapters at each revision level (0, 1, 2, 3)

#### 3. Redesigned Dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
**Row 1 - Main Stats:**
- ✅ Exam Countdown (unchanged)
- ✅ **Overall Progress** - Now shows % of (pages + 3 revisions) with "pages + 3 revisions" label
- ✅ **Revision Progress** - NEW! Shows average revision cycle (e.g., "1.5/3")
  - Purple gradient background
  - Displays "avg revisions" subtitle
  - Shows encouraging messages: "🏆 Master!" (3.0), "🌟 Excellent!" (2.0+), "📚 Good start!" (1.0+)
- ✅ Daily Streak (unchanged)

**Row 2 - Revision Breakdown (NEW):**
Four mini-gadgets showing chapter distribution:
- ⚪ **Not Started** - Chapters at 0/3 revisions (gray background)
- 🔵 **1st Revision** - Chapters at 1/3 revisions (blue background)
- 🟡 **2nd Revision** - Chapters at 2/3 revisions (yellow background)
- 🟢 **3rd Revision** - Chapters at 3/3 revisions (green background)

#### 4. Added Revision Undo Functionality (`app/subjects/[id]/page.tsx`)
**New Feature - Click to Add or Undo Revisions:**
- ✅ Click on a **completed revision** (green with ✓) to **undo** it
- ✅ Click on the **next available revision** (blue) to **complete** it
- ✅ Disabled revisions (gray) require previous revisions to be completed first
- ✅ Visual feedback with checkmarks on completed revisions
- ✅ Tooltip hints: "Click to undo this revision" or "Click to complete this revision"

**How It Works:**
```
Example: Chapter has 2 revisions completed [✓ Rev 1] [✓ Rev 2] [ Rev 3]
- Click Rev 2 → Undoes Rev 2 → [✓ Rev 1] [ Rev 2] [ Rev 3]
- Click Rev 3 → Completes Rev 3 → [✓ Rev 1] [✓ Rev 2] [✓ Rev 3]
```

#### 5. Auto-Refresh Dashboard on Navigation (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
**New Feature - Dashboard Auto-Updates:**
- ✅ Dashboard automatically refetches data when you navigate back from other pages
- ✅ Uses browser `visibilitychange` event to detect when page becomes visible
- ✅ Ensures progress gadgets always show current data
- ✅ Works seamlessly when undoing revisions in subject pages

**User Experience:**
1. Go to dashboard → See current progress
2. Navigate to subject page → Undo a revision
3. Navigate back to dashboard → **Progress automatically updates!**

### Visual Improvements
- Removed the old "Total Revisions" gadget (which just showed a sum)
- Added color-coded revision breakdown for better visual tracking
- Made "Overall Progress" clearly include both pages AND revisions
- Added visual hierarchy to help users understand their revision status at a glance
- Added checkmarks (✓) to completed revision buttons
- Added "(Click to add or undo)" hint text on revision tracking

### Progress Calculation Formula
**Overall Progress = (Pages Completed + Revision Work) / (Total Pages × 4) × 100%**

Where:
- **Total Pages × 4** = All pages need to be read once + revised 3 times
- **Pages Completed** = Sum of all completed pages across all chapters
- **Revision Work** = For each completed chapter: Total Pages × Revisions Completed

Example:
- 100 total pages, 50 pages completed, 2 chapters fully completed with 2 revisions each (20 pages each)
- Work completed = 50 + (20 × 2) + (20 × 2) = 50 + 40 + 40 = 130
- Total work = 100 × 4 = 400
- Progress = 130/400 × 100 = 32.5%

### Benefits
1. **Accurate Overall Progress** - Now reflects the true amount of work (pages + revisions)
2. **Clearer Tracking** - Users can now see exactly how many chapters are at each revision stage
3. **Better Motivation** - Visual breakdown shows progress through the 3-revision system
4. **Flexible Revision Management** - Can undo revisions if marked by mistake or need to redo
5. **Actionable Insights** - Users can identify which chapters need more revision work
6. **Realistic Progress** - 100% means truly finishing all work, not just reading pages once

# Previous Changes - Production Configuration

## 🔧 Changes Made for Production Setup

This document outlines the changes made to configure the app for production Firebase backend while keeping the frontend running locally.

---

## ✅ What Was Changed

### 1. Removed Emulator Support

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/firebase.ts` - Removed emulator connection logic
- `firebase.json` - Removed emulators configuration
- `package.json` - Removed emulator scripts

**Why?**  
Emulators were causing connection issues. Production Firebase is more stable and simpler to use.

### 2. Cleaned Up Scripts

**`package.json` - Before:**
```json
"firebase:emulators": "npx firebase-tools emulators:start --only auth,firestore,functions",
"firebase:emulators:all": "npx firebase-tools emulators:start",
```

**`package.json` - After:**
```json
// Removed emulator scripts
// Kept only production deployment scripts
```

### 3. Deleted Emulator-Focused Documentation

**Files Deleted:**
- `LOCAL_TESTING.md` - Emulator testing guide
- `CREATE_USER_GUIDE.md` - Emulator user creation
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Old setup with emulator instructions
- `CHECKLIST.md` - Emulator-focused checklist

### 4. Created Production-Focused Documentation

**New Files:**
- `PRODUCTION_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive production setup guide
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide for Firebase Hosting
- `CHANGES.md` - This file

**Updated Files:**
- `README.md` - Now production-focused
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Simplified 10-minute production setup
